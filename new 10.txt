If indicators on contact gets updated ---> update it's Customer Account Indicators which will also update Asset Indicators (since those are formulas to Customer Account)
As indicators are updated on contact this should be the triggering point.

If trigger is on AssetContactRoles__c then we will not know if they are any updated to indicators on contact so it's not possible to update Asset and Account.
Even though, Contact and Asset association can be updated/deleted

1. If Asset Contact Role is inserted/updated/deleted/undeleted:
	a. Do we need to update Customer Account related to Asset accordingly? - this is implemented for insert and update
	b. Do we need to update Customer Account related to Contact accordingly?

re evaluate the other ASR --  tirgger -->fires

update contact trigger/ class -- 


update account class

end dated role -- end_date_role__c as deleted.(ACR) and Asset

only query the asset where asset end date is null or today < end date 

if there an end date -- its dead.
